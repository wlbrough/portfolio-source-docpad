This project started as a Top Coder challenge that I ended up abandoning due to time constraints. I am still working on it as a personal project and I will keep the code open-source. The code base is derived from [Code School's sqlite-parser](https://github.com/codeschool/sqlite-parser) and is built using [PEG.js](http://pegjs.org/).

You can view the project [on Github](https://github.com/wlbrough/soql-parser).
