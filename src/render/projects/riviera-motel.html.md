The [Riviera Motel](http://www.shadowofthebridge.com) is an independently owned and operated motel in Mackinaw City, MI with a stunning, unobstructed view of Lake Michigan and the Mackinac Bridge between Michigan's upper and lower peninsulas.

The [Riviera Motel website](http://www.shadowofthebridge.com) was built on WordPress. I set up and configured the WordPress and developed a custom, fully-responsive theme for the website and integrated an existing external booking system.
