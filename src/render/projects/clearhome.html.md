Each item you own comes with a small cognitive load attached. Too many possessions will cloud your mind and have a negative impact on your feeling of wellbeing. clearhome helps you figure out what you have and get rid of what you don't need.

This project is just getting started and the only thing publicly facing is the landing page. The back-end of the project is being built on Go/MongoDB and the front-end is being built with React. I plan to use React Native to produce phone applications as well.
