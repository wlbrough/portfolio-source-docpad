What f#&king programming language should I use? is a tounge-in-cheek guide to choosing a programming language. Inspired by the endless nerd battles online about the "best" programming language in any scenario, this app turns it into a joke so we can all have some fun and stop taking ourselves so f#&king seriously.

The app was built with [KnockoutJS](http://www.knockoutjs.com). It was my first time using the framework and it was pleasantly simple compared to work I've done with Angular and Ember. If you don't need the power of Angular, Ember, or some other huge front-end framework, I would recommend taking a look at [KnockoutJS](http://www.knockoutjs.com).
