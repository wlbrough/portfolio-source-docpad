Technical books and courses do not fare well on platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. TechStarter (working name) is a platform for individuals interested in these projects to create or fund great work in the technical community.

This project is underway, but there are no public artifacts at this time. The back-end of the project is being built with Elixir and the Phoenix framework. The front-end is built with Ember.
