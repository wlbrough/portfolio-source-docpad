I came on as the senior develper on UI8 with the site complete and operational. I have since moved the application from a VPS to Heroku, improved server response times by over 25%, and implemented a new checkout flow for the site.

I have implemented a variety of new features for the customer facing site and the admin back-end. Some of these updates include:

* A new, modular notification system
* An updated workflow for reviewing, updating, and approving new product submissions
* Added capability to create products with a recurring subscription

The site is built on a Node, Express, Angular, MongoDB stack. It integrates with Stripe, Paypal, Slack, and Mandrill APIs.
